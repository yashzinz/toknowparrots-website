              Keshav entered our lives as a fragile 7-month-old baby bird from a
              pet shop. He couldn’t fly, and his fear was heartbreaking —
              screaming if anyone approached him. We didn’t know then that a
              seed-only diet wasn’t ideal for him, and unknowingly, we began
              with a lot of mistakes. Still, we hoped love would be enough.

              Just weeks later, we brought home Soham — a gentle, cheerful girl
              who was Keshav’s polar opposite. She quickly grew fond of us,
              always eager to play and explore. Keshav, meanwhile, stayed
              distant and reserved, often watching quietly from afar. But having
              Soham nearby brought a new energy into the home — a hope that
              maybe Keshav, too, would open up one day.

              Tragedy struck unexpectedly — Soham fell ill and passed away
              within hours at the vet. Her death was devastating. She had
              brought so much joy in her short life. We buried her by a quiet
              beach, where the sky stretched wide — a place where she could fly
              forever free. Her loss made us realize how little we knew, and how
              much we needed to change.

            <div class="journey-desc">
              Motivated by Soham’s memory, we began transforming how we cared
              for Keshav. We studied, consulted with vets, and began feeding
              fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted grains. I sat with him
              daily, softly talking, offering treats from a distance, and
              playing music. One quiet morning, Keshav climbed onto my shoulder
              and gently took a treat. That small gesture was a breakthrough —
              the beginning of a deep, mutual trust.

              Months of patience, love, and a proper diet finally bore fruit —
              Keshav’s flight feathers regrew. And then, it happened: he took
              his very first full flight around our home. It was beautiful and
              indescribable. He had endured fear, trauma, and loss — but in that
              moment, he was truly free. His feathers grew vibrant, and with
              each flap, so did his confidence.

              For the first time, Keshav genuinely enjoyed being showered. We
              misted him gently with a plant bottle while soft music played, and
              he fluffed up, danced, and flapped joyfully. It became our weekly
              ritual — his happy showers, always paired with music. It’s one of
              his favorite activities now, and ours too.

              We discovered Keshav’s love for watching Amazon parrots on YouTube
              and parrot videos on his little tablet. He’d watch with curiosity
              and sometimes even chirp back. Around this time, we also began
              formal training — starting with “step-up” using a stick, and then
              moving to recall training. Today, he flies to my hand when called,
              eager for his favorite treat and a cuddle.

              Wanting to take him on safe, enriching walks, we started

              strangers and the outdoors still scare him. But slowly, we’re
              building up his comfort so one day, he can safely visit parks or
              go for gentle walks in the winter sun. It’s a work in progress —
              but we’re in no rush. Every step is worth celebrating.
